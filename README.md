# Isomorph-core-tri
Isomorph, Third iteration, Unity 5, Flat sprite based approach. Goals: proper sorting algorithm, unit sprite slicing and clean sprite finishing.

ESSENTIAL: gain understanding how projection to screen and object depth and coordinates relate.

To be added
	- Basic functionallity
		* Iso classes
		* Map storage
		* Ingame object builder
	- Compatibillity for multiple heights of slab projection (at least [1] and [srt2_srt3]).
	- XML based text importer, competable with microsoft excel xml export.
	- A way to sort the sprites without using to lagre a numeric width.
	- A mouse click even collision checker using math and stuff.
		* find a way to obtain all coordinates object in a  simulated "raycast" in order.
		* wirte a scripts that efficiently goes trough them to find first collision.
		* Find appropriate selectable object on vertical stack.

Methods [Not nesseseraly inengine] that have to be disscovered
	- Proper sprite slicing
	- How to clean to graphics edges
